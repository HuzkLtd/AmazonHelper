*Last Updated: March 1, 2025*

## Introduction

Thank you for choosing AmazonHelper. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our Chrome extension. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our practices.

## Information We Collect

AmazonHelper collects and stores only the following information:

- **User Preferences**: We store your extension settings (such as dark mode preference, sponsored content filtering options, Prime-only filter status, and other customization choices) using Chrome's built-in storage API.
- **Page Data Processing**: The extension processes Amazon page content (such as product listings, sponsored content indicators, and pagination elements) temporarily in your browser to provide filtering functionality.

## How We Use Information

The information we collect is used exclusively for the following purposes:

1. **Storing Your Preferences**: We save your settings locally on your device to remember your preferences between browsing sessions and across devices (if you're signed into Chrome and have sync enabled).

2. **Providing Core Functionality**: We process page content to identify and filter sponsored content, enhance product listings, improve navigation, and deliver the features described in our extension description.

## Data Storage and Transmission

- **Local Storage Only**: All user preferences are stored locally on your device using Chrome's secure Storage Sync API.
- **No External Transmission**: We do not transmit your data to any external servers, databases, or third parties.
- **No Tracking**: We do not track your browsing activity, search queries, or purchasing behavior.
- **No Personal Information**: We do not collect any personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, or payment details.

## Third-Party Access

AmazonHelper does not share any information with third parties. All data processing occurs locally within your browser, and no external services or APIs are used to handle your data.

## Data Security
